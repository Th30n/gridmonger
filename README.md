## Build instructions

Requires [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) 1.6.6+

### Dependencies

* [koi](https://github.com/johnnovak/koi)
* [nim-glfw](https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-glfw) (`gridmonger` branch)
* [nim-nanovg](https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-nanovg/)
* [nim-osdialog](https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-osdialog)
* [nim-riff](https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-riff)
* [winim](https://github.com/khchen/winim)

You can install most of the dependencies with [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble):

```
nimble install nanovg osdialog riff winim
```

For `koi` and `nim-glfw`, clone their Git repositories, check out the
`gridmonger` branch in `koi`, then install both with `nimble develop` for
local development.


### Compiling

Debug build (debug logging enabled, file dialogs disabled on Windows ):

```
nim debug
```

Release build:

```
nim release
```

### Packaging

#### Windows

Use the correct 32/64-bit Nim compiler & GCC toolchain to compile the 32 and
64 binaries, respectively.

The installer executable is generated by [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System); make sure to install it first.

Run `nim release` first to create a release build.

To create the 32/64-bit Windows installers (requires `makensis.exe` on the
path):

```
nim packageWin32
nim packageWin64
```

To create the portable distribution in `dist/win-portable` (the ZIP file needs
to be created manually):

```
nim packageWinPortable
```

#### macOS

Run `nim release` first to create a release build.

To create the macOS application bundle:

```
nim packageMac
```
