  - thick wall style (for Companion style)
  - indexed notes:
      option to use rectangles (with larger font) (don't draw bg when cursor is

LOW PRIORITY
  - proper multi-window handling in csdwindow
  - better csdwindow separation (e.g. titlebar)

  - undo after cut/erase/etc selection should restore cursor to selection to
    left corner, not bottom right (too hard?, requires no undo system)

  - in paste preview mode, you cannot use "negative" col & row paste
    destination

  - left edge of spinner symbols is cut off on high zoom levels on retina screens

  - better undo manager

  - 32 bit version?
